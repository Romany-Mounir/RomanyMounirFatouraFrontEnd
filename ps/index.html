B. The End Of Every Day

inputstandard input
outputstandard output
As you know Ashraf's company is still small but it's productive!!, at the end of every day, only k products remain so Ashraf is in the same task every day and he tries to sell them with the maximum total price.

n buyers come to Ashraf every buyer offers a price for every product trying to buy all of the k products but Ashraf can sell to every buyer zero or more of the remaining products.

Ashraf will sell the products in a way such that every product i (1≤i≤k) is sold to exactly one buyer. i.e Every product will be sold exactly once.

Given n arrays each of size k, every array representing the prices of the k products offered by this buyer.

you have to print the number of different ways that Ashraf can sell the k products with the highest possible sum.

two ways are considered different if some product i, (1≤i≤k) is sold to a different buyer.

Input
You have to answer multiple scenarios. The first line contains the number of scenarios t (1≤t≤100). Description of every scenario follows.

The first line of each scenario consists of two space-separated positive integers n and k (1≤n≤10,1≤k≤10) where n is number of buyers and k is number of the products.

Then You're given n lines, In every line, you're given k integers ai (1≤ai≤109) where ai represent the offer for the i−th product.

Output
for every scenario print the number of ways.

It's guaranteed that the answer fits in a 64−bit integer.

C. The Maximum Profit

inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Ashraf love analysis and he always tries to use all the data to optimize the process of selling the products and increasing the profit.

Ashraf has the data of the last n days, for every day i (1≤i≤n) the value ai is the profit in the i−th day.

Ashraf believes that if for some consecutive days the sum of the profits is less than or equal to k then he has to do some changes in the company, so Ashraf was wondering for every day i what is the maximum day j (i≤ j≤n) such that the sum of profits between i and j is less than or equal to k.

can you help Ashraf to solve this task?

Input
You have to answer multiple scenarios. The first line contains the number of scenarios t (1≤t≤105). Description of every scenario follows.

The first line of each scenario consists of two space-separated positive integers n and k (1≤n≤105,1≤k≤109) where n is number of days and k is the integer in the problem.

In the second line, you're given n integers ai (1≤ai≤k) where ai represent the profit of the i−th day.

it's guaranteed the sum of n over all the scenarios is ≤3⋅105
Output
for every scenario print n space separated integers in one line,

for every index i the the maximum index j such that Sum(i,j) ≤ k.

ِAshraf wants to hire a smart software engineer. He Believe that people who can solve counting problems are smart.

Let's define P(n) = multiplication of the digits of n , and S(n) = sum of the digits of n.

Given two positive integers a and b. Find the number of different n such that P(n) = a and S(n) = b.

Input
The first line contains one integer T — the number of test cases.

The following T lines each line contains two integers a and b. (1≤a,b≤104).

Output
For each test case, output the required answer on a single line.
